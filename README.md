# Problem Statement: PS1: Digital Lost-and-Found Platform for Public Spaces

---

# üîç What We Understood from the Problem Statement:
Lost and Found counters are not efficient in daily life. An Online Lost and Found Platform can be a huge improvement to the whole idea, with Images, Descriptions, Locations, Time being listed, helping people find lost items. 

# üõ† Our Approach / How We Plan to Solve It:
Have 3 main pages/portals:
1. A search portal to be able to give as much information related to the lost item, based on filters mainly for type, location, time.
2. A home page to display lost items in general, for a given Area.
3. An option to add entries for lost items, again with filters/tags. 

# üß∞ Tech Stack:
C# for both Frontend and Backend.
